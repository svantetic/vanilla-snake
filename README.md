# vanilla-snake
## what kind of sorcery is this?
Plain and simple - it is a snake game written in JavaScript using pure Canvas API and some other boring stuff. It will have simple score system, but entire gameplay is pretty straightforward.

## what i'm trying to accomplish here?
I wanted to get into object oriented programming in JS. ECMAScript6 syntatic sugar makes pseudo-OOP code easier to write and read, so I have decided to use Babel transpiler running through Gulp task runner. I didn't want to use a game library like Phaser, because I want to learn how to code a basic game from scratch.

## tests?
Recently I heard a very interesting claim, that the most important thing about good code is unit testing. 
I have read about JS testing frameworks and libraries and decided to use Mocha and Chai for testing my game. Test are very simple, and I am not sure about their design, but I think they are a good foundation for future improvement.

## boring stuff

- babel
- gulp
- gulp-babel
- gulp-sourcemaps
- mocha
- chai

## how to run?

- `git clone`
- `npm install`
- `gulp`
